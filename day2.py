# Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, 
# except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. 

# centered_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 100]) → 3 (1 100)... (2 + 3 + 4) => 9 ==> 9 / 3 => 3
# centered_average([1, 1, 5, 5, 10, 8, 7]) → 5 (1 + 5 + 5 + 8 + 7) // 5

# how many integers to work with? (min 3 ints)
# if there are more than 1 largest or smallest value what do we do? we remove only 1
# do we need to account for floating points in our answers? no we only want to use int answers //

# PLAN & EXECUTE
# maybe use min / max?
# maybe use builtins?
